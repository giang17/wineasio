; Wine-specific symbols from ntdll.dll for WineASIO (32-bit)
; __wine_unix_call_dispatcher is now loaded dynamically via GetProcAddress
; to avoid import resolution issues on 32-bit WoW64 where the DATA export
; was being incorrectly resolved as a function call to NULL
; NtQueryVirtualMemory is also loaded dynamically via GetProcAddress to avoid
; stdcall decoration mismatch between mingw (@24) and Wine (undecorated)
